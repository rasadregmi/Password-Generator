# Password Generator

This project is a React-based password generator application designed to help users create secure passwords with customizable criteria. The application provides an intuitive user interface where users can specify the length of the password and choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Once the criteria are selected, users can generate a random password that meets their specifications and copy it to the clipboard for easy use.
